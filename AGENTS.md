# Programming Agent Guidance

- Run `pnpm install` before other commands.
- Use `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` to validate changes.
- Keep styles in StyleX and ensure new components have Storybook stories and tests.
- Database migrations are managed with Drizzle. Run `pnpm exec drizzle-kit push` after schema changes.
- Update documentation when adding features.
