# Authentication

Authenticated users can upload documents from the **Uploaded Work** page. The server stores the original file, a summary generated by the LLM, and timestamps for when the work was completed and uploaded. Embedding vectors are generated with the `multimodal-embedding-3-small` model and indexed using SQLite's builtâ€‘in **VSS** extension for fast similarity search. The page lists each of your uploads with its summary for easy review.
New uploads appear immediately in the list with a temporary "Processing..." placeholder while the LLM generates the summary. Any upload errors are shown next to the list.
