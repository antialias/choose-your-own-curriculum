# Home Page

The home page now features a simple hero section with quick links to common tasks.
If you are signed in, the links display the number of students and curriculums you
currently have. Use these links to jump straight to managing students, viewing
curriculums or uploading work. A math skill selector is also available to
generate a Mermaid DAG of prerequisites using the builtâ€‘in LLM client.
