# My Curriculums

The **My Curriculums** page lists every topic graph you've generated and saved from the Curriculum Generator. Click a row to view the full graph. Each entry shows when it was created and which topics were included. When a curriculum is saved the server kicks off a background job that fetches embeddings for each node's tags so they can be matched to uploaded work.
