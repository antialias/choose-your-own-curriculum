# My Curriculums

The **My Curriculums** page lists every topic graph you've generated and saved from the Curriculum Generator. Click a row to view the full graph. Each entry shows when it was created and which topics were included.

When a curriculum is first saved the server extracts all node tags and embeds new ones in the background. The list displays the current progress as `Tag processing: X/Y` until complete.
When viewing an expanded graph you can hover over any node to see its tags.
