# Student Progress

Click a student's name from the **Students** page to open their progress view. The top of the page shows the selected curriculum along with the topics and rendered DAG. If no curriculum is assigned you can pick one from your saved DAGs. Below the curriculum section all uploaded work for that student is listed using the same interface as the **Uploaded Work** page.

Each upload now displays the most relevant topics from the current curriculum. The list is ordered by similarity between the work's embedding vector and the average embedding of each topic's tags. The percentage next to each topic indicates how closely that work relates to the topic.
