# Student Progress

Click a student's name from the **Students** page to open their progress view. The top of the page shows the selected curriculum along with the topics and rendered DAG. If no curriculum is assigned you can pick one from your saved DAGs. Below the curriculum section all uploaded work for that student is listed using the same interface as the **Uploaded Work** page. Each piece of work shows which curriculum nodes are most closely related along with a relevancy percentage.
