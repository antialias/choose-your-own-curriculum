# Student Progress

From the **Students** page you can select a student to view their progress. The top of the page shows the assigned curriculum with its topics and rendered DAG. If no curriculum is assigned you can pick one from your saved DAGs. Below the curriculum section all uploaded work for that student is listed using the same interface as the **Uploaded Work** page.
